Pytroll is an easy to use, modular, free and open source python framework for the processing of earth observation satellite data. The provided python packages are designed to be used both in R&D environments and in 24/7 operational production.

The focus is on atmospheric applications and imaging sensors, but as seen from the list of supported satellite sensors below the data that can be handled by Pytroll allows the usage in a wide range of earth sciences.

## Pytroll packages and supported data

You can find the complete list of pytroll packages on github.com: <https://github.com/pytroll>.
Also checkout this [overview description](pytroll_packages_overview.md) of all packages and their mutual 
dependencies, maturity and known operational usage.

A non exhaustive list of supported satellites and formats is provided here: <http://satpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>
