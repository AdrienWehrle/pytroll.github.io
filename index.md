Pytroll is an easy to use, modular, free and open source python framework for the processing of earth observation satellite data. The provided python packages are designed to be used both in R&D environments and in 24/7 operational production.

The focus is on atmospheric applications and imaging sensors, but as seen from the list of supported satellite sensors below the data that can be handled by Pytroll allows the usage in a wide range of earth sciences.

## Pytroll packages and supported data

You can find the complete list of pytroll packages on github.com: <https://github.com/pytroll>.
Also checkout this [overview description](pytroll_packages_overview.md) of all packages and their mutual 
dependencies, maturity and known operational usage.

A non exhaustive list of supported satellites and formats is provided here: <http://satpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>

## Tutorials, examples...

For a quick and easy overview of what Pytroll can possibly offer for you have a look at the [Pytroll overview](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10QSq6H0QL4WruEiY-1TU4Rk-f05QzZOZ1UoD9adx9ow/edit?usp=sharing) which was shown at the 2017 Eumetsat conference in Rome Tuesday October 3rd.

## Announcements

### Next PyTroll Contributers Week(s)

The 2019 PyTroll Contributers Weeks (PCWs) have not yet been decided. We expect to announce them early 2019.

The PCWs is a gathering of the developers and users of PyTroll during which they address issues and new features in 
the project and work/code together. It is a great opportunity to learn more about PyTroll and get involved in 
the development. Some experience with Python is desirable to enjoy the PCW at its full potential :)

Questions can be asked on the mailing list, on pytroll.slack.com 

### Last Workshop

The autumn 2018 PyTroll Contributers Week took place at the EUMETSAT head quarters, in Darmstadt, Germany, 
from Monday November 26th to Friday November 30th.
