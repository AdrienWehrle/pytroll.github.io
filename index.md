Pytroll is an easy to use, modular, free and open source python framework for the processing of earth observation satellite data. The provided python packages are designed to be used both in R&D environments and in 24/7 operational production.

The focus is on atmospheric applications and imaging sensors, but as seen from the list of supported satellite sensors below the data that can be handled by Pytroll allows the usage in a wide range of earth sciences.

## Pytroll packages and supported data

You can find the complete list of pytroll packages on github.com: <https://github.com/pytroll>.
Also checkout this [overview description](pytroll_packages_overview.md) of all packages and their mutual 
dependencies, maturity and known operational usage.

A non exhaustive list of supported satellites and formats is provided here: <http://satpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>

## Tutorials, examples...

## Announcements

### Next Pytroll Contributor Week (PCW)

The 2019 Autumn Pytroll Contributor Week (PCW) will be at the Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI) in Copenhagen, 
from November 25th till 29th. This Pytroll Week also marks the 10 years anniversary of Pytroll!
Please the [announcement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V9g0C-6f6VzgBaBeiH3ZYroeHLSsxcF9_o8V5hSgE5g/)

The PCWs is a gathering of the developers and users of Pytroll during which they address issues and new features in 
the project and work/code together. It is a great opportunity to learn more about Pytroll and get involved in 
the development. Some experience with Python is desirable to enjoy the PCW at its full potential :) Due to the format
of the PCW meeting it is not necessary to attend all 5 days. It is perfectly acceptable to come to a PCW and spend
the time learning how to use Pytroll tools in your own workflow.

Any questions can be asked on the mailing list or on pytroll.slack.com (see "Getting in touch" above).

### Past PCWs

The spring 2019 Pytroll Contributor Week took place at the Pyle Center on the University
of Wisconsin - Madison Campus hosted by the Space Science and Engineering
Center (SSEC) in Madison, WI, USA from 13th to 17th of May, 2019. This was
the first workshop in the Americas with a total of 24 people attending
through the week. Attendees came from Europe and North
America including many first time attendees from the SSEC, CIRA, NRL, and
NOAA.
