Pytroll is a suite of open source easy to use Python packages to facilitate processing and efficient sharing of Earth Observation satellite data. The PyTroll software is both intended for 24/7 real time operations as well as for research and development.

Below is a short summary of all packages developed by and/or maintained by the PyTroll community. There is a great spread in the size and complexity of the packages, and they may address rather different issues related to the processing and handling of satellite data.

If you are new to PyTroll, and have some satellite data you want to read and display, you should start out by getting familiar with SatPy!

# All existing general PyTroll packages

## SatPy

* **Summary**: Python package for earth-observing satellite data processing. Reading many level-1 and -2 products, resamples the data, generates composite RGB imagery, and saves in a few standard formats such as netCDF, geoTIFF or png. Satpy is replacing Mpop (see below).

* **Development intensity**: High

* **Maturity**: Becoming mature

* **PyTroll dependencies**: PyResample, PyKdtree, Trollimage, Trollsift

* **Optional PyTroll dependencies**: PySpectral, PyOrbital, PyGAC, Mipp, Python-geotiepoints, Pytroll-schedule.

* **Other dependencies**: NumPy, Pillow, Pyyaml, Six

* **In 24/7 production @**: FMI, MeteoSwiss, DWD, ESTEA, LEGMC, IMO, ECCC...
