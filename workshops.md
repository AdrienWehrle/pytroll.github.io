### Workshop 2013, November, Norrk√∂ping

After a two day open workshop we were 7 pytrollers from Finland, Iceland and Sweden staying till the end of week working 
together on some pressing issues. See below for a summary of achievements. If you would like to contribute actively with 
the pytroll development, please let us know at the mailing list (pytroll@googlegroups.com) or chat with us directly on the 
pytroll slack: https://pytrollslackin.herokuapp.com/. We plan to have two pytroll weeks (usually 4-5 days of dedicated 
programming) each year. Usually we will identifiy a few specific topics that we think needs special attention.

#### Summary achievements

 - Extending the user community: Several new users have become more familiar with Pytroll and started contributing.
 - Testing: A number of bugs and user inconveniences were identified, and some have been solved already.
 - Enhancements to Pyresample:
   - Now Pyresample allows to attach a weight to the gaussian reprojection method. This is convenient when e.g. gridding
     several swath products into a level 2.5/3 product (Climate applications).
 - MIPP enhancements and user documentation: MIPP allows XRIT decompression on the fly, and MIPP documentation 
   slightly improved.
 - Three new projects initiated:
   - Pydecorate to add logos, text, color bars and stuff to images
   - Trollimage - an enhancement of the image.py module in mpop including some color enhancements. 
     Will deprecate image.py in mpop
   - Trollduction - A modular batch production framework for Pytroll
 - netCDF reader for SSM/I
 - Trollcast testing, for data exchange between SMHI and FMI - resolution is pending (time outs)
 - Designing and developing the FMI Pytroll based polar production system. Probably resulting in a general concept that can
   be useful to other users
 - Looking at how to enable web based batch production monitoring with Pytroll. Could e.g. be used for an easy and quick access
   to Pytroll products for in-house R&D
 - Initiated an overhaul and check of the EUMETSAT recipe RGBs in Pytroll and how they compare and deviate with the official
   ones. Done in collaboration with the Romanian Met Service.
 - Colorizing Pytroll images (using the new trollimage component) - "sandwich" product. Color enhanced imagery is commonly
   used in forecast offices, e.g. IR imagery with cold temperatures enhanced using a color palette.
